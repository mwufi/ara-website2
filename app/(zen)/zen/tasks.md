- [ ] Add a common layout & header nav (Today, Week, All Time) views
- [ ] Profile card


Today view (zen)
- what we have now, i guess
- show current time & how much time we have left in the day (auto updating ofc)
- maybe add a schema thing for notes, and allow a (collapsible) side panel for daily notes

Week view (zen/weekly)
- show a bar graph (shadcn really helps) of productivity every day
- below, show a list of things we did by day

All Time (zen/all-time)
- just extend the bar graph to longer time frame
- stats (454 sessions counted, 29091 total minutes, etc)

On the top right of the nav should be a circle avatar, with a profile page
zen/profile

should take me to my profile page

## small improvements
- [ ] Make the tab header say how much time is left!!

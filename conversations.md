# Conversational Waitlist Feature

## Allowing every user to have a personalized conversation with our AI

### Feature Overview
Transform the traditional waitlist experience into an engaging conversational interface where users interact with our AI chatbot. Instead of simply collecting emails, we create meaningful connections through conversation while seamlessly handling authentication and onboarding.

## Core User Flow

### 1. Instant Chat Access
- User visits the waitlist page
- Chat interface immediately available - zero barriers!
- AI greets them warmly: "Hey there! I'm here to learn about what you're building and see how we can help. What brings you here today?"
- No signup, no email, no friction - pure engagement

### 2. Natural Conversation & Engagement
- AI engages in natural conversation about:
  - User's needs and pain points related to the pruct
  - Their current solutions and challenges
  - Use case scenarios and goals
  - Timeline and urgency
  - Company context and role
- AI builds genuine interest and rapport
- User gets value from the conversation itself

### 3. Strategic Email Collection
- **After engagement is high**, AI naturally transitions to email:
  - "This has been really insightful! I'd love to keep you in the loop as we build this out - what's the best email to send you updates?"
  - "Want me to save our conversation and send you personalized updates? Just need an email!"
  - "Based on what you've shared, I think you'd be perfect for our beta - can I grab your email to add you to the list?"
- **Immediate value**: "Perfect! I'll send you a summary of our chat + early access info. Check your inbox in a few minutes!"

### 4. Post-Email Enhanced Experience  
- Email verification (optional but encouraged)
- Return visitors get personalized experience: "Welcome back! Ready to continue where we left off?"
- Chat history preserved and referenced
- AI can provide more personalized insights and updates
- Priority access to new features based on conversation data

## Technical Architecture

  preferences: object
  waitlistStatus: 'anonymous' | 'email_provided' | 'verified'
}

Conversations {
  id: string
  userId: string (nullable - can start anonymous)
  sessionId: string (for anonymous tracking)
  emailCollected: boolean
  emailCollectedAt: timestamp (nullable)
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

Messages {
  id: string
  conversationId: string
  role: 'user' | 'assistant'
  content: string
  timestamp: timestamp
  metadata: object (insights, extracted data, etc.)
}

UserInsights {
  id: string
  userId: string (nullable)
  conversationId: string
  painPoints: string[]
  useCase: string
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  currentSolution: string

- `MessageList.tsx` - Displays conversation history
- `MessageInput.tsx` - User input with typing indicators
- `AnonymousWelcome.tsx` - Initial AI greeting for anonymous users

#### 2. Email Collection Flow (`@/components/email/`)
- `InlineEmailCapture.tsx` - Natural email collection during chat
- `EmailSuccessMessage.tsx` - Confirmation after email provided
- `ConversationSummary.tsx` - Email summary of the chat

#### 3. Session Management (`@/components/session/`)
- `AnonymousSession.tsx` - Manages anonymous user sessions
- `SessionPersistence.tsx` - Preserves chat across visits
- `UserTransition.tsx` - Handles anonymous → registered transition

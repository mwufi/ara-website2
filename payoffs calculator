# Startup Payoffs calculator

				
	Probabilities of reaching each stage (eventually)			
				
	$1M revenue	$10M revenue	$50M revenue	$100M revenue
Ara	60%	50%	25%	10%
Dex	90%	60%	30%	10%
Ara + Dex	95%	85%	60%	30%
				
	Payoffs (at each stage), millions			
	1	10	50	100
				
	Expected Payoffs in different scenarios			
50% of Ara
50% of Dex
10% of Ara + Dex
etc

I want to create a calculator where we can adjust the probabilities of reaching each stage in revenue, and it shows me the expected payoffs for a founder of the company. this way, i can easily compare, and tweak the numbers

I also want to store these calcualtors in instantdb. let's say i go to
/calculator/<roomId>
and play around with it. so then i'd have a data structure that represents this rooms like:

{
    "outcomes": [
        {"name": "$1M revenue", "payoff": 1000000},
        {"name": "$10M revenue", "payoff": 10000000},
        {"name": "$50M revenue", "payoff": ... },
    ],
    "scenarios": [
        {
            "name": "Ara",
            "probabilities": [0.60, 0.50, 0.20, etc]
        },
        {
            "name": "Dex",
            "probabilities": "...
        }
    ],
    "ownership percentages": [
        { "name": "50% of Ara", "multiplier": 0.5, "scenario": "Ara" }
    ]
}
and from this stored data, we can compute what it'd be worth! and it'd update as we change the numbers, and save to this data structure automatically

InstantDB (since it actually syncs across clients) gives us a good multiplayer experience!

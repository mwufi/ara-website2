Frames is our newest base model for image generation, marking a big step forward in stylistic control and visual fidelity. The model excels at maintaining stylistic consistency while allowing for broad creative exploration. Frames can establish a specific look for your project and reliably generate variations that stay true to your aesthetic.

We're gradually rolling out access inside Gen-3 Alpha and the Runway API to allow you to build more of your worlds within a larger, more seamless creative flow.

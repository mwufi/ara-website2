If you know us, you'd most likely know that we are an AGI consumer company.

We're building the best, most advanced, coolest, most able AI on the planet. The *luxury* AI. The best AI that money can buy. We take post-trained foundation models and *make them better, more integrated, and useful in your life*.

So you're probably thinking: why email?

## the first email client that acts like you

What we're building is a combination of friend, personal assistant, and email client: A long-lived AI agent that learns from you, precisely how you go through mail ("hey, next time, just archive these"). Over time, we want to build a model so good (because it's been with you everywhere), you can trust it to do things for you.

- Responses get written before you look at it
- You get instant, clear summaries about exactly what matters to you
- It expands from mail to CRM & calendar, to keep up with the people & activities in your life

## Email with superpowers

Imagine if email became multi-player. This happens all the time - Superhuman has a "comment" feature when you need to route relationships between different members of your time. Emails have a "CC"/"BCC" to loop people in. with MailPuppy, you can go one step further - get *email awareness* as part of your AI stack.
- For example, send emails from Slack
- "@MailPuppy can you ask Justine if she's seen this?"
- "@MailPuppy can you summarize all my deals this month in a newsletter?"


## From isolated e-mails to connected story

If we design the right email client, it'd be an indispensable assistant: one that not only knows how you operate, but your entire life story. It'd be condensing the past to outperform in the present & future.

The mail clients today are all centered on the same thing: processing lots of mail. But for most of us, email is more than just an inbox.

Your email remembers when you were accepted to college. Shows you the time you connected with a really awesome friend. Maybe you found your latest read on email. The best email client isn't just about *getting to inbox zero*. Your life's purpose isn't just processing messages, but rather, in deepening relationships, making connections, and being (with the help of some tools) the all-around super-mom (or dad) who says things no one forgets.

How would interacting with this email client feel? We think it'd feel something like running with MailPuppy, or "humanity's best friend".

## From workspace to home

So when we thought about building a new email assistant, we thought: it'd be like a pet, a loving part of the family. It'd be shared across people, providing an interpersonal space to communicate.

This is a new challenge, a new type of AI -- something that multiple people can share. An AI that keeps context, and models the independent goals of all of its users. If we build this right, it could be really cool.

Almost like a group chat, something ambient you can talk to -- as much a fixture of the family life as the shared walls of the house.
